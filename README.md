## 📖 Introduction

The **Sales Analysis Project** focuses on breaking down a large dataset into manageable parts, analyzing the data with SQL, and solving various analytical problems.  
The dataset was split into **6 CSV files**, each representing a specific table/schema. SQL scripts corresponding to these CSV files are included for creating and querying the data.  
Additionally, this repository contains a **bonus folder** with an extra dataset, SQL script, and corresponding analytical questions.

**Products**: Includes information about products such as IDs, names, and prices.
**Categories**: Lists product categories and their descriptions.
**Departments**: Details about organizational units managing products.

## 🗃️ SQL Scripts

Each SQL script corresponds to one of the datasets, enabling easy table creation and data analysis. The scripts are modular and can be run independently.

## ❓ Questions Addressed

* What are the most profitable product categories?
* How do sales and profits vary by month?
* Which products have the highest profit margins?
* How many unique products do customers purchase on average?
* Which shipping modes are most popular?
* For a full list, refer to **questions.txt**.
